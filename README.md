Simple Pong is, as you might guess, a simple game made with Unity, which mimics the original Pong game;

Additionally, there is a pause button and a menu to change the resolution of the game screen;
To download it, simply click on the green button on the "Release" button (on the right side of your screen).

CONTROLS:
P1 - W is up, S is down;
P2 - ArrowUp is up (no way right?), ArrowDown is down.
